## Fifteen free steps to get started in web development.
<!--more-->

This is the roadmap I wish I had when I first started coding, a sequential list of free, quality resources designed to help beginners get started in front-end web development. There are tons of great free resources out there, but it's hard to know where to start, what to learn, and how to use those skills in the real world. These study guides cover the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using what I've found to be the most effective online learning platforms.

## Beginning JavaScript

__1. Why Study JavaScript?__

Read [this article](https://skillcrush.com/learn-javascript) to gain a better understanding of the power of JavaScript.

__2. Watch and Code__

Gordon Zhu's  **Watch and Code**  will allow you to get your hands dirty with some real JavaScript code. Remember that you need to actively code along with the videos. Using Gordon's instructions, try out the code from the videos on your own. Experiment and break the code, this is an excellent way to gain a better understanding.
Sign up for [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) and complete  **versions 1-2**  of the example application _and_ the  **functions and variables interlude**.

__3. How does JavaScript work in the browser?__

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpZIEejKDY&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLGC-hHIh7l5vs0uDGlQEXQGQR2hW8Gcwl)

__4. More Watch and Code__

Build upon the JavaScript basics you already practiced with more  **Watch and Code**. Remember to code along with the video, experiment, and break things. Return to [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) and complete  **versions 3-6**  of the example application.

## Troubleshooting Strategies

__5. When you get stuck...__

Troubleshooting is a huge part of the development process. All developers regardless of skill level spend a ton of time debugging their code. Having strategies to turn to when you encounter a bug can save time, help you better learn from your mistakes, and keep frustration at bay. Take a look at [this set of troubleshooting strategies](https://hackernoon.com/5-techniques-for-troubleshooting-your-code-266abda0418c) and try them out next time you hit a snag.

__6. Using Stack Overflow__

[**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/company) is the industry standard for getting help online. The platform allows you to ask and answer questions regarding any imaginable development topic. I highly encourage you to sign up for an account. For more information view the [Stack Overflow Tour](https://stackoverflow.com/tour).

## Add Some HTML

__7. What is HTML?__

**HyperText Markup Language's**  job is to format information in a way that makes sense when viewed in a web browser.  **HTML**  describes the structure and purpose of web content. Read [Mozilla's introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

__8. Practice some plain HTML__

Complete the [Codecademy HTML course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

__9. Introduction to the DOM__

JavaScript enhances webpages by providing all sorts of extra features that can't be achieved with plain HTML. The technology that allows JavaScript to interact with an HTML document is called  **The Document Object Model**. Read [this introduction](https://css-tricks.com/dom/) to the DOM and [this more detailed description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).

__10. Integrating JS + HTML__

Use HTML and JavaScript together to create an interactive webpage by finishing the remaining sections on  **Watch and Code**. Complete the remaining lessons on [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)

## Add Some CSS

__11. What is CSS?__

Read [This introduction to CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_intro.asp)

__12. Practice CSS__

You will find a great interactive CSS tutorial on  **Free Code Camp**. Complete  **parts 1-17**  of [Free Code Camp's CSS course](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css)

__13. CSS Zen Garden__

Visit [CSS Zen Garden's website](http://www.csszengarden.com/) and click the "View all Designs" button to see examples of different CSS styles applied to the same HTML document. Additionally, you can download the source code of each example to view its CSS code. View the CSS code on [CSS Zen Garden's website.](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

__14. More CSS Practice__

Complete  **the remaining sections** of [Free Code Camp's CSS course](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css)

__15. CSS Approaches__

When writing CSS, using a consistent and organized approach is extremely important. Take a look at a couple of CSS methodologies that might help prevent [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). Read about the following CSS methodologies and consider making use of them in your CSS files:

- [Maintainable CSS](https://maintainablecss.com/chapters/introduction/)
- [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/book/)
- [Multilayer CSS](https://operatino.github.io/MCSS/en/)
