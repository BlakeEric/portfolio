As an independent developer I spend a lot of time teaching myself new concepts. Luckily, the internet is full of free educational resources to help web professionals improve their craft. This is my attempt to consolidate the best ones in a single location, because we all get tired of googling stuff.  As I work mainly in JavaScript, most of the resources I use tend to focus on that language. However, I make use of a lot of tools that span many topics as well.
